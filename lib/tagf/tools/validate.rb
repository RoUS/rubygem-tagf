    # render it into an image file.
    #
    # Invisible Location and Path elements are depicted in red, with
    # the paths using dashed rather than solid lines.
    #
    # Path elements which are marked reversible use a single arrowhead
    # to retain the indication of the main direction.  If a path is
    # <em>not</em> reversible, a double-arrowhead is used to emphasise
    # that it's a one-way-only path.  So:
    #
    # * One arrowhead (`→`)
    # : The path is reversible, and commands for 'go back' will
    #   backtrace along it.
    # * Double arrowhead (`↠`)
    # : The path is IRreversible; once followed, 'go back' commands
    #   won't return along it.
    #
    # Paths which are sealable (`kind_of?(TAGF::Mixin::Sealable)`)
    # <em>and</em> openable will be annotated with either a door "🚪"
    # (if not lockable) or a padlock.  If it's locked, a padlock & key
    # "🔐" will be used; if it's unlocked, an open padlock "🔓" will
    # be used.

locked items with no keys defined, &c.

The name of the YAML file to check is either passed as an
