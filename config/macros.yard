# @!macro [new] doc.TAF.module
#   Top-level module namespacing all of the pieces of the `sptaf` gem.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF...module.classmethod.included
#   Method invoked whenever this module is included as a mixin.  It
#   is passed the class (or module) object that is including it.  We
#   extend the caller's eigenclass with the classmethods module,
#   which adds various class methods (like TAF::ClassMethods#flag).
#  
#   @param [Class,Module] klass
#     Object that is including this module as a mixin.
#   @return [void]

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ClassMethods.module
#   Define class methods and constants that will be added to all
#   modules and classes in the TAF namespace.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ClassMethods.module.eigenclass
#   Define methods and constants that live in the modules' and class'
#   eigenclasses (<em>a.k.a.</em>, `singleton classes'.  Things like
#   the `extended` and `included` metamethods live in the eigenclass.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ClassMethods::Thing.module
#   Define class methods and constants that will be added to all
#   object classes in the TAF namespace.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ClassMethods::Thing.module.eigenclass
#   Define methods and constants that live in the modules' and class'
#   eigenclasses (<em>a.k.a.</em>, `singleton classes'.  Things like
#   the `extended` and `included` metamethods live in the eigenclass.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ContainerMixin.module
#   Mixin module defining methods specific to objects that have
#   inventories.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::ContainerMixin.module.eigenclass
#   Mixin module defining methods specific to objects that are
#   locations in a game (rooms, <em>etc.</em>.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::Exceptions.module
#   Mixin module defining methods specific to objects that are
#   locations in a game (rooms, <em>etc.</em>.

# @!macro [new] doc.TAF::Thing.module
#   Mixin module defining common methods for all objects in a game.
