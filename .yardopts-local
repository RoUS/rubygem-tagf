# Only put options in `.yardopts` that are commonly reusable to
# multiple projects.  Options and file-lists which are extremely
# project-specific should be stored in this .yardopts-local file.
# (Such as `--title="Project Title"`, or the decision as to whether
# markdown should be handled by Yard or perhaps by something else
# like Pandoc.)
#
# For one thing, manually processing this file allows us to
# do things like, I don't know, *embed comments* in it.
#
# Format:
#
# Comment lines start with ^[[:space:]]*#
# End-of-line comments start with any token matching ^#
#
# All detectable comments are stripped before processing further.
#
# Other line formats (regex):
#
#   ^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*$
#	A line containing just a single dash, this indicates that any
#	filespecs that follow are 'extra' files in Yard terms, and the
#	dash and those filespecs will retain their position at the end
#	of the command line.
#
#   ^[[:space:]]*--?[-[:alnum:]]
#	This pattern indicates that the line contains an option for
#	the Yard command.  It will be collected with other options and
#	their order maintained.
#
#   ^[[:space:]][^-#]
#	Lines matching this pattern are filespecs for Yard to parse.
#	Extended globbing (`\*\*`) is permitted.
#
# The final command line is built from
#
#	[options] [filespecs] [-] [extra-filespecs]
