1	 You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
1	 building.  Around you is a forest.  A small
1	 stream flows out of the building and down a gully.
2	 You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.
2	 The road now slopes back down the other side of the hill.
2	 There is a building in the distance.
3	 You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
4	 You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling
4	 along a rocky bed.
5	 You are in open forest, with a deep valley to one side.
6	 You are in open forest near both a valley and a road.
7	 At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a
7	 2 inch slit in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8	 You are in a 20 foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into
8	 the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry
8	 streambed leads into the depression.
9	 You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the
9	 surface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the West.
10	 You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a
10	 dim light at the East end of the passage.
11	 You are in a debris room, filled with stuff washed in from
11	 the surface.  A low wide passage with cobbles becomes
11	 plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon
11	 leads upward and West.
11	 A note on the wall says 'Magic Word XYZZY'.
12	 You are in an awkward sloping East/West canyon.
13	 You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls
13	 are frozen rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a
13	 good passage exit from East and West sides of the chamber.
14	 At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An
14	 East passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
15	 You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of
15	 sight to the West.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide
15	 stone staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with
15	 wisps of white mist swaying to and fro almost as if alive.
15	 A cold wind blows up the staircase.  There is a passage
15	 at the top of a dome behind you.
16	 The crack is far too small for you to follow.
17	 You are on the East bank of a fissure slicing clear across
17	 the hall.  The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is
17	 too wide to jump.
18	 This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.
18	 It says 'You won't get it up the steps'.
19	 You are in the hall of the mountain king, with passages
19	 off in all directions.
20	 You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21	 You didn't make it.
22	 The dome is unclimbable.
23	 You can't go in through a locked steel grate!
24	 You don't fit down a two inch hole!
25	 You can't go through a locked steel grate.
27	 You are on the West side of the fissure in the hall of mists.
28	 You are in a low N/S passage at a hole in the floor.
28	 The hole goes down to an E/W passage.
29	 You are in the South side chamber.
30	 You are in the West side chamber of hall of Mt King.
30	 A passage continues West and up here.
31	 There is no way across the fissure.
32	 You can't get by the snake.
33	 You are in a large room, with a passage to the South,
33	 a passage to the West, and a wall of broken rock to
33	 the East.  There is a large 'Y2' on a rock in the room's center.
34	 You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35	 You are at a window on a huge pit, which goes up and
35	 down out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible
35	 over 50 feet below.  Directly opposite you and 25 feet away
35	 there is a similar window.
36	 You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the East is a crawl.
36	 To the West is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to
36	 another passage.
37	 You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.
37	 A crawl leads West.
38	 You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little
38	 stream, which enters and exits through tiny slits.
39	 You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  there is a
39	 big hole in the floor.  there are cracks everywhere, and
39	 a passage leading East.
40	 You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel
40	 to and North of the hall of mists.
41	 You are at the West end of hall of mists.  A low wide crawl
41	 continues West and another goes North.  To the South is a
41	 little passage 6 feet off the floor.
42	 You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43	 You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
44	 You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
45	 You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

55	 You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
56	 Dead end
57	 You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive
57	 orange column down one wall.  You could climb down here
57	 but you could not get back up.  The maze continues at this
57	 level.
58	 Dead end
59	 You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel
59	 to and North of the hall of mists.
60	 You are at the East end of a very long hall apparently
60	 without side chambers.  To the East a low wide crawl slants
60	 up.  To the North a round two foot hole slants down.
61	 You are at the West end of a very long featureless hall.
62	 You are at a crossover of a high N/S passage and a low E/W one.
63	 Dead end
64	 You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees
64	 passage from the North joins a higher crawl
64	 from the East to make  a walking passage going West
64	 There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
64	 A sign in midair here says 'cave under construction beyond
64	 this point.  Proceed at own risk.'
65	 You are in bedquilt, a long East/West passage with holes everywhere.
65	 To explore at random select North, South, up, or down.
66	 You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.
66	 Obvious passages go West,East,ne, and
66	 nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large bedrock block.
67	 You are in the twopit room.  The floor
67	 here is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it
67	 easy to descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassing
67	 the pits to connect passages from East and West.  There
67	 are holes all over, but the only big one is on the wall
67	 directly over the East pit where you can't get to it.
68	 You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an
68	 immense slab fallen from the ceiling(slab room).  East and
68	 West there once were large passages, but they are now filled
68	 with boulders.  Low small passages go North and South, and the
68	 South one quickly bends West around the boulders.
69	 You are in a secret ns canyon above a large room.
70	 You are in a secret N/S canyon above a sizable passage.
71	 You are in secret canyon at a junction of three canyons,
71	 bearing North, South, and se.  The North one is as tall
71	 as the other two combined.
72	 You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead n, se, and sw.
73	 dead end crawl.
74	 You are in secret canyon which here runs E/W.  It crosses over
74	 a very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may
74	 not be able to get back up
75	 You are at a wide place in a very tight N/S canyon.
76	 The canyon here becomes to tight to go further South.
77	 You are in a tall E/W canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet
77	 North and seems to open up.
78	 The canyon runs into a mass of boulders - dead end.
79	 the stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer
79	 pipes.  It would be advisable to use the door.

1	 Somewhere nearby is colossal cave, where others have found
1	 fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored
1	 that some who enter are never seen again.  Magic is said
1	 to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct
1	 me with commands of 1 or 2 words.
1	 (Errors, suggestions, complaints to Crowther)
1	 (If stuck type 'help' for some hints)
2	 A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3	 A little dwarf just walked around a corner,saw you, threw
3	 a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4	 There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
5	 One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
6	 He gets you!
7	 None of them hit you!
8	 A hollow voice says 'plugh'.
9	 There is no way to go that direction.
10	 I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or
10	 nearby objects.
11	 I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name
11	 something in the general direction you want to go.
12	 I don't know how to apply that word here.
13	 I don't understand that!
14	 I always understand compass directions, or you can name
14	 a nearby thing to head that way.
15	 Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will
15	 repeat the long description of your location.
16	 It is now pitch black.  If you proceed you will likely
16	 fall into a pit.
17	 If you prefer, simply type W rather than West.
18	 Are you trying to catch the bird?
19	 The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch it
19	 no matter what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
20	 Are you trying to attack or avoid the snake?
21	 You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it,
21	 or anything like that.  There is a way to get by, but you
21	 don't have the necessary resources right now.
22	 My word for hitting something with the rod is 'strike'.
23	 You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24	 You are already carrying it!
25	 You can't be serious!
26	 The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach
26	 it becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27	 You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28	 There is nothing here with a lock!
29	 You aren't carrying it!
30	 The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an
30	 astounding flurry drives the snake away.
31	 You have no keys!
32	 It has no lock.
33	 I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34	 The grate was already locked.
35	 The grate is now locked.
36	 The grate was already unlocked.
37	 The grate is now unlocked.
38	 You have no source of light.
39	 Your lamp is now on.
40	 Your lamp is now off.
41	 Strike what?
42	 Nothing happens.
43	 Where?
44	 There is nothing here to attack.
45	 The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46	 Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47	 You killed a little dwarf.
48	 You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49	 I have trouble with the word 'throw' because you can throw
49	 a thing or throw at a thing.  Please use drop or attack instead.
50	 Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51	 I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
51	 describes places and is used to move you there.  To move try
51	 words like forest, building, downstream, enter, East, West
51	 North, South, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects,
51	 like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be
51	 manipulated using one of the action words that I know.  Usually
51	 you will need to give both the object and action words
51	 (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from
51	 the verb alone.  The objects have side effects - for
51	 instance, the rod scares the bird.
51	 Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few
51	 more words.  Usually people trying to manipulate an
51	 object are attempting something beyond their (or my!)
51	 capabilities and should try a completely different tack.
51	 To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances
51	 with a single word.  For example, 'building' usually gets
51	 you to the building from anywhere above ground except when
51	 lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a
51	 lot, and that leaving a room to the North does not guarantee
51	 entering the next from the South.  Good luck!
52	 It misses!
53	 It gets you!
54	 OK
55	 You can't unlock the keys.
56	 You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up
56	 back in the main passage.
57	 I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream
57	 can run on the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58	 I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59	 I can only tell you what you see as you move about
59	 and manipulate things.  I cannot tell you where remote things
59	 are.
60	 I don't know that word.
61	 What?
62	 Are you trying to get into the cave?
63	 The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You
63	 cannot enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.
63	 I would recommend looking elsewhere for the keys.
64	 The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,
64	 with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite
64	 a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus
64	 nondescritpt bushes of various sorts.  This time of year
64	 visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel
64	 is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry bushes.
65	 Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
66	 Digging without a shovel is quite impractical: even with a
66	 shovel progress is unlikely.
67	 Blasting requires dynamite.
68	 I'm as confused as you are.
69	 Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time
69	 in caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign
69	 of a deep pit leading down to water.
70	 Your feet are now wet.
71	 There is nothing here to eat.
72	 Eaten!
73	 There is no drinkable water here.
74	 The bottle of water is now empty.
75	 Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.
75	 Anyway, nothing exciting happens.
76	 Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77	 Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78	 You can't pour that.
79	 Watch it!
80	 Which way?
