      You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees
      passage from the North joins a higher crawl
      from the East to make  a walking passage going West
      There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
      A sign in midair here says 'cave under construction beyond
      this point.  Proceed at own risk.'

      here is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it
      easy to descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassing

      are holes all over, but the only big one is on the wall
      directly over the East pit where you can't get to it.

      Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found
      fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored
      that some who enter are never seen again.  Magic is said
      to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct
      me with commands of 1 or 2 words.

      I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
      describes places and is used to move you there.  To move try
      words like forest, building, downstream, enter, East, West,
      North, South, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects,
      like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be
      manipulated using one of the action words that I know.  Usually
      you will need to give both the object and action words
      (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from
      the verb alone.  The objects have side effects - for
      instance, the rod scares the bird.
      Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few
      more words.  Usually people trying to manipulate an
      object are attempting something beyond their (or my!)
      capabilities and should try a completely different tack.
      To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances
      with a single word.  For example, 'building' usually gets
      you to the building from anywhere above ground except when
      lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a
      lot, and that leaving a room to the North does not guarantee
      entering the next from the South.  Good luck!

      The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,
      with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite
      a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus
      nondescritpt bushes of various sorts.  This time of year
      visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel
      is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry bushes.
